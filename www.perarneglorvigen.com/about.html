      <h1>Per Arne Glorvigen</h1>
      <br>
      <p><strong>Per Arne Glorvigen is among the foremost of todays bandoneon players.</strong></p>
      <br>
      <p>His contact with this instrument began as late as at the age of 25 when he after having finished the State
        Academy of Music in Oslo, moved to Paris and met the Argentinian bandoneon maestro Juan José Mosalini.</p><br>
      <p>After studying with Mosalini and after several stays in Buenos Aires, Glorvigen began his career as a
        professional bandoneonist. Meetings with tango legends Piazzolla, Pugliese, Salgán and close friendship with
        poet
        Horacio Ferrer were crucial.</p><br>
      <p>In addition to playing tango, Glorvigen has expanded the repertoire of the bandoneon by playing everything from
        baroque, kletzmer, pop and last but not least; contemporary music. Composers like Willem Jeths (Holland), Bernd
        Franke (Germany), Henrik Hellstenius (Norway) and Luis Naon (Argentina / France) have all dedicated concertos to
        Glorvigen. Among Glorvigens musical partners we find artists as Nicolas Altstaedt, Natalie Clein, Marie-Pierre
        Langlamet, Göran Sölscher, the ensemble Tango for 3, the Leipziger, Delian, Maxwell, Apollon Musagète and Alban
        Berg Stringquartets, Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bremen, Staatskapelle Dresden, Komische Oper Berlin, the BBC
        Symphony Orchestra, Liverpool Philharmonic, Orchestra Guiseppe Verdi Milano, the Oslo, Stockholm, Gothenburg,
        Malmö and Copenhagen (DR) Philharmonic, the Russian National Orchestra, the Soloists of the Orchestre de Paris
        and
        l&#8217;Orchestre National d&#8217;ile de France.</p><br>
      <p>Nevertheless, his most important collegue has been violonist Gidon Kremer with whom he has recorded 4 CDs and
        played nearly one hundred concerts worldwide.</p>
      <p>His main partners today are the memebers of the Glorvigen-Trio: violinist Daniela Braun and the doublebassist
        Arnulf Ballhorn.</p><br>
      <p>Per Arne Glorvigen has also worked as an entertainer and comedian with language sketches as a speciality.</p>
      <br>
      <p>After studies with&nbsp;Eric Tanguy (composing) and Guillaume Connesson (orchestration) in Paris, Glorvigen now
        dedicates himself more and more to composition and his works have been performed in most European countries.
        Commands for 2019/20/21 include pieces for the Oslo Philharmonic, The Apollon Musagète Quartet and the Arctic
        Sinfonietta.</p><br>
      <p>The first CD with own works &#8220;Paris, Buenos Aires, Chicago&#8221; appeared february 2019 including cellist
        Andreas Brantelid and the Norwegian Chamber Orchestra.</p><br>
      <p>Recordings for Simax, Auvidis, Nonesuch, Sony Classical, Teldec, EMI Classics and Deutsche Grammophon.</p>
