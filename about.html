      <h1>Per Arne Glorvigen</h1>
          <p><strong>Per Arne Glorvigen is among the foremost of todays bandoneon players.</strong></p>
          <p>His contact with this instrument began as late as at the age of 25 when he after having finished the State Academy of Music in Oslo, moved to Paris and met the Argentinian bandoneon maestro Juan José Mosalini.</p>
          <p>After studying with Mosalini and after several stays in Buenos Aires, Glorvigen began his career as a professional bandoneonist. Meetings with tango legends Piazzolla, Pugliese, Salgán and close friendship with poet Horacio Ferrer were crucial.</p>
          <p>In addition to playing tango, Glorvigen has expanded the repertoire of the bandoneon by playing everything from baroque, kletzmer, pop and last but not least; contemporary music. Composers like Willem Jeths (Holland), Bernd Franke (Germany), Henrik Hellstenius (Norway) and Luis Naon (Argentina / France) have all dedicated concertos to Glorvigen. Among Glorvigens musical partners we find artists as Nicolas Altstaedt, Natalie Clein, Marie-Pierre Langlamet, Göran Sölscher, the ensemble Tango for 3, the Leipziger, Delian, Maxwell, Apollon Musagète and Alban Berg Stringquartets, Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bremen, Staatskapelle Dresden, Komische Oper Berlin, the BBC Symphony Orchestra, Liverpool Philharmonic, Orchestra Guiseppe Verdi Milano, the Oslo, Stockholm, Gothenburg, Malmö and Copenhagen (DR) Philharmonic, the Russian National Orchestra, the Soloists of the Orchestre de Paris and l&#8217;Orchestre National d&#8217;ile de France.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, his most important collegue has been violonist Gidon Kremer with whom he has recorded 4 CDs and played nearly one hundred concerts worldwide.</p>
          <p>His main partners today are the memebers of the Glorvigen-Trio: violinist Daniela Braun and the doublebassist Arnulf Ballhorn.</p>
          <p>Per Arne Glorvigen has also worked as an entertainer and comedian with language sketches as a speciality.</p>
          <p>After studies with&nbsp;Eric Tanguy (composing) and Guillaume Connesson (orchestration) in Paris, Glorvigen now dedicates himself more and more to composition and his works have been performed in most European countries. Commands for 2019/20/21 include pieces for the Oslo Philharmonic, The Apollon Musagète Quartet and the Arctic Sinfonietta.</p>
          <p>The first CD with own works &#8220;Paris, Buenos Aires, Chicago&#8221; appeared february 2019 including cellist Andreas Brantelid and the Norwegian Chamber Orchestra.</p>
          <p>Recordings for Simax, Auvidis, Nonesuch, Sony Classical, Teldec, EMI Classics and Deutsche Grammophon.</p>
